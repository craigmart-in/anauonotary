                <h3>Services Area</h3>
                <p>I understand that certain situations require a notary at inconvenient times.  I started this business to serve the community during those inconvenient times and am here for you and your family. As a mobile notary public service, I can travel to your work, home, health care facility, or any public place if you prefer for your convenience.</p>
                <p> I am based out of Waconia, Minnesota.  I conveniently service the counties of:  Carver,  Hennepin,  Scott,  but I am open to travel beyond those counties as needed. </p>
